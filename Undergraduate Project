#During my undergraduate studies, I completed a machine learning project analyzing the impact of rainfall and temperature on cocoa yield.

## ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF RAINFALL AND TEMPERATURE PATTERNS ON COCOA YIELD USING MACHINE LEARNING

### Description
This project explores the relationship between climatic factors, specifically rainfall, and temperature, and their impact on cocoa yield. By leveraging machine learning models, the goal is to predict cocoa yield based on historical weather patterns, providing insights into how climate changes can affect cocoa production.

### Project Structure
- **Data Collection:** The dataset includes historical data on rainfall, temperature, and cocoa yield over a specified period.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of various machine learning models including Support Vector Regression, Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regression to predict cocoa yield.
- **Analysis:** Evaluating the models' performance and analyzing the results to determine the influence of climatic factors on cocoa yield.
